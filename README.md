### Topic and dataset
Predict MVP of basketball game

What is the most important statistic which defines who will be the MVP?

### Create a mockup of a machine learning model

Model:
Supervised as the data set has labels

Output of data:
Regression? - predicting the value/outcome

Algorithim:
Linear Regression
